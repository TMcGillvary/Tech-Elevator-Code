Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_employee()

Expected output:
timesheetList.size() returns 2 after calling the getTimesheetsByEmployeeId() method for employeeID 1L

Actual output:
timesheetList.size() only returns 1

How did you fix this bug?
Typo in code if (results.next()), replaced with while (results.next())
Test now runs as expected


Bug 2
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByProjectId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project()

Expected output:
timesheetList.size() returns 3 after calling getTimesheetsByProjectId(1L)

Actual output:
timesheetList.size() only returns 2

How did you fix this bug?
Typo in SQL statement "WHERE employee_id = ?", replaced employee_id with project_id
Test now runs as expected


Bug 3
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
updated_timesheet_has_expected_values_when_retrieved()

Expected output:
Timesheet 4L would be updated with the new values

Actual output:
Billable is not updated from false to true when method is run

How did you fix this bug?
Billable is missing from updateTimesheet() method. Added billable to method
Code now runs as expected

Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getBillableHours_returns_correct_total()

Expected output:
Employee 2L and Project 2L returns 0 as hours worked are not billable

Actual output:
getBillableHours outputs 2.0 hours billed

How did you fix this bug?
billable = true missing from WHERE clause, added into code
Code now runs as expected
